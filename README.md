## Web Application
***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***
The web application consists of a frontend written in Razor views, HTML, CSS,
Bootstrap, Popper, and jQuery. The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core 2, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.
An interface is provided to create new blog
posts, view existing blog posts, edit existing blog posts, delete existing
blog posts, and search by both keywords and usernames. All blog posts can be
enriched using Azure Language Services (part of Microsoft's Cognitive Services
suite), Bing Image API, and Parallel Dots (for automated tagging of posts via
key phrases detected within the post's body). Image enrichments can be added
based on the overall sentiment score (a range 0.0 - 1.0 related to the mood
of the post) and key phrases / keywords detected in the posts. Optionally, users
can choose to opt-out of these features for privacy or data collection concerns.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
